/*Write a method valid_triangle? which takes as its input three non-negative numbers. It should return true if the three numbers could form the side lengths of a triangle and false otherwise.

The arguments don't correspond to specific sides. Don't worry about handling negative inputs â€” garbage in, garbage out.

For example,

valid_triangle?(0,0,0) # => false, because a triangle can't have 0-length sides

valid_triangle?(1,1,1) # => true, an equilateral triangle

valid_triangle?(3,4,5) # => true, a right triangle
valid_triangle?(4,3,5) # => true, the same right triangle
valid_triangle?(5,3,4) # => true, the same right triangle

valid_triangle?(10, 10, 100) #=> false, no such triangle exists*/
