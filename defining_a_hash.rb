Exercise: Defining a Hash
Define a Hash variable called my_info which has the following keys:

:first_name
:last_name
:hometown
:age
Use your own personal information to fill in the keys. Make sure :age is a positive integer and the rest are non-empty Strings.

The Hash needs to be stored in the my_info variable.

# my_info is empty to start.  Edit this!
